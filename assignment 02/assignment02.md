# Assignment 02 Pilot Usability Test | Crystal Huynh, DH 110 F2021 


## Introduction
The Massachusetts Department of Education website supports the Board of Higher Education's mission of creating and maintaining a public higher education system that provides Massachusettes' citizens with opportunities to gain access to these services. The site supports students and their families as well as college/university faculty and staff with financial aid programs, DACA resources, veterans education information, and more.

After conducting a heuristic analysis on this website, the top three issues I want to check with users on whether they feel the issues are challenging, unsatisfactory, and/or inefficient are:

* Visibility of System Status: As the user navigates the site, there are some links that take a user to a totally different section of the site when they expect to stay in the same section as documented in the breadcrumb navigation feature. This may confuse users with where they are in the site. If the user misclicked, it is difficult to navigate back to where they were without using the browser's back button instead of using the breadcrumb feature.
* Consistency and Standards: Some of the tabs in the navigation bar take the user to what seems to be a completely different website. If that page is supposed to be a part of the main website, the different design is confusing to users. 
* Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: Since the site has a navigation bar at the top of the site, it can get overwhelming for the user to click on a tab and see even more options on the side navigation, especially when some of the options on the side navigation do not show up in a drop down of the top navigation bar.


## Methodology
In order to improve the site from the user's perspectives,  I will conduct a usability test to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the website with the user performing specific tasks.

Heuristic Being Tested|Task Scenario
|---|---|
|Visibility of System Status|task 1|
|Consistency and Standards| task 2
|Flexibility and Efficiency of Use| task 3|

I will conduct the test in a quiet room, recording the pilot test on Zoom with my MacBook. The user and I will be on call throughout this process. I'll start with an introduction of the pilot test and then ask for their informed consent before continuing. The user will answer some background questions about the website and then move on to the pre-test questions to give their first thougths and impressions before performing the task scenarios. I will have the user perform tasks 1 through 3 and observe how the website affect's their ability to efficiently and effectively complete them. The user will then answer the post-test questions to measure their experience when completing the tasks. The test will end with demographics questions about the user which will be kept confidential and anonymous.
